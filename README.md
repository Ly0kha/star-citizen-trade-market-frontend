## Why dont you use <a href="https://www.versemate.com" target="_blank">VerseMate</a>?

I really like VerseMate!
However, there are a few things that VerseMate (currently) does not support

This API and the associated frontend has the following advantages:

- Community-based _the data is not read from the game_
- API _frontend is completely decoupled from the API_
- Open Source _everyone can contribute_
- You can provide item prices to your main organization or make them available to all your organizations
